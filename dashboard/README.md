# CloudCull Dashboard 📊

The **CloudCull Dashboard** is a high-fidelity React application designed to visualize the "Kill Lists" generated by the core engine. It transforms raw JSON logs into an executive-level status board.

## 🌟 Features
*   **"Kill List" Visualization:** Instantly see which instances are marked as `ZOMBIE`.
*   **Financial Impact:** Real-time calculation of potential monthly savings.
*   **Identity Shaming:** Highlights the specific users (`@john.doe`) responsible for waste.
*   **Zero-Backend:** Reads directly from the `report.json` generated by the CLI, allowing it to be hosted on GitHub Pages or S3 without a dedicated server.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
*   **Vite:** Ultra-fast build tool.
*   **React:** Component-based UI.
*   **CSS Modules:** Scoped styling for a "Dark Mode" cyber-security aesthetic.

## 🚀 Setup & Build

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Run Locally
```bash
npm run dev
```
Navigate to `http://localhost:5173`. The dashboard will load the sample data from `public/report.json`.

### 3. Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
```
This generates static assets in `dist/` that can be deployed to any static host (GitHub Pages, Netlify, S3).

## 🔄 Integration Flow
1.  **Core Engine** runs `main.py` and outputs `report.json`.
2.  **GitHub Action** saves this JSON artifact.
3.  **Deploy Job** copies the `dist/` folder and the new `report.json` to the `gh-pages` branch.
