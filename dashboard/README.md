# CloudCull Dashboard 📊

The **CloudCull Dashboard** is a high-fidelity React application designed to visualize the "Kill Lists" generated by the core engine. It transforms raw JSON logs into an executive-level status board.

## 🌟 Features
*   **"Kill List" Visualization:** Instantly see which instances are marked as `ZOMBIE`.
*   **Financial Impact:** Real-time calculation of potential monthly savings.
*   **Identity Shaming:** Highlights the specific users (`@john.doe`) responsible for waste.
*   **Secure Log Streaming:** Built-in terminal stream to view audit logs without exposing them to the public internet (requires secure backend).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
*   **Vite + React:** Modern frontend.
*   **Python (stdlib):** Secure backend server for logs/reporting.

## 🚀 Setup & Build

### 1. Build Frontend
```bash
npm run build
```

### 2. Run Locally (Secure Mode)
```bash
# From project root
python3 src/dashboard_server.py
```
Navigate to `http://localhost:8080`.

### 3. Legacy Dev Mode
```bash
npm run dev
```
Navigate to `http://localhost:5173`. *Note: Logs will not be available in this mode.*

## 🔄 Integration Flow
1.  **Core Engine** runs `main.py` and outputs `report.json` and `logs/sniper.log`.
2.  **Secure Server** (`dashboard_server.py`) serves the `dist/` folder and proxies data from the local filesystem via secure APIs.
3.  **Client** renders the state and streams logs from `/api/logs`.
