# Project Blueprint: CloudCull (The GPU Sniper)
> **2026 High-Ticket Target:** Senior Multi-Cloud Engineer / FinOps Architect ($200+/hr)

## 🎯 The "Investor" Vision
CloudCull isn't just a script; it's a **Governance & Cost Execution Framework**. It bridges the gap between "Passive Monitoring" and "Active Financial Enforcement" across AWS, GCP, and Azure.

---

## 🏛️ "Investor Grade" Modular Architecture
To prove $200+/hr expertise, we move beyond a single script. We use a **Modular Adapter Pattern**.

```
cloudcull/
├── adapters/          # Cloud-specific logic (boto3, azure-sdk, gcp-sdk)
├── core/              # The "Brain" - Logic that decides if a node is a zombie
├── llm/               # Model-Agnostic LLM Clients (Claude, Gemini, Llama)
├── integrations/      # Execution handlers (Terraform trigger, Slack notifier)
└── main.py            # CLI Entrypoint
```

## 🏗️ The "Must-Have" Investor Features

### 1. Identity & Attribution (CloudTrail)
*   **The Feature:** Cross-reference idle instances with **CloudTrail/Audit Logs** to find exactly *who* launched the resource.
*   **The Value:** "It’s not enough to delete the server; we must alert the owner." This is the **Governance** layer enterprise clients demand.

### 2. Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) Evolution
*   **The Feature:** Instead of raw API deletions, CloudCull generates a **Targeted Terraform Plan** or triggers a GitHub Action to scale down a cluster.
*   **The Value:** Proves you know how to work within a **GitOps** workflow without breaking production state.

### 3. The "Execution" Brain (Multi-Model AI)
*   **The Feature:** Pluggable LLM interface to reason about cost v. utility.
*   **The Value:** Shows the difference between a "Scripter" and an "AI Solutions Architect."

## 🚀 Execution Strategy for You:
1.  **Refactor to Modules:** Break the single `gpu_sniper.py` into the folder structure above.
2.  **Add the "Attribution" Logic:** Add a function that queries `boto3.client('cloudtrail')` to find the `userIdentity`.
3.  **The "Wow" Output:** Ensure the CLI output says: *"Found idle H100. Launched by: @dev_john. Potential Savings: $2,800/mo."*

## 📈 The Dashboard Option
For the portfolio, a **High-Fidelity Vite/React Dashboard** is a great "Visual Proof." 
*   **Recommendation:** Keep the dashboard as a *viewer* of the "Cull Logs" generated by the engine. This makes the system look like a complete SaaS product.
