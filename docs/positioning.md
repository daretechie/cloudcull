# Positioning: CloudCull vs. Valdrix

To maximize your value as a consultant, you should position these tools as a "Double-Threat" strategy.

## 🏹 CloudCull: The "Special Forces" Sniper
- **Type**: Lightweight CLI / Execution Script.
- **Portability**: Zero-infrastructure. Run from your laptop or a GitHub Action.
- **ROI**: Focused exclusively on 1-second audits and "Immediate Kill" actions.
- **Use Case**: The "Foot in the Door" tool. Walk into a client's office, run an audit, and show them $10,000 in monthly waste instantly.

## 🛡️ Valdrix (CloudSentinel-AI): The "Enterprise Aircraft Carrier"
- **Type**: Full SaaS Platform / Governance Hub.
- **Infrastructure**: Requires database, frontend, and backend hosting.
- **ROI**: Longitudinal value optimization, GreenOps, and automated remediation workflows over months.
- **Use Case**: The "Long-Term Retention" tool. Once you've proved value with CloudCull, upsell the client to Valdrix for 24/7 autonomous governance.
